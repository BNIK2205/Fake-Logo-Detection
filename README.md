This paper deals with finding fake logo by matching and recognizing it with the original logo. This is done by dividing the image of logo into rows and columns and thus each cell has its index value .Taking the index value of each cell which belongs to the image of logo to be verified check it with the original image index value of the corresponding cell. From the relation between index values of both the original logo and the one being considered we could decide it whether it is fake logo or original logo. If the index values of all the cells are exactly matching with the actual logo then it is considered to be original logo, otherwise it is the fake logo. This process is achieved by using CNN logo detection and recognition algorithm.
